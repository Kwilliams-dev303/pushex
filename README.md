# PushEx

## TODO (Prioritized)

- Write installation guide (standalone)
- Write JS documentation
- Better controller 422 handling (show specific field reasons)
- Load testing harness
- Write installation guide (existing phoenix app)

## Possible Enhancements

- Replace `PushEx.Instrumentation.Push` implementation as phoenix instrumenters
  - This would be for performance reasons
  - It may not be necessary depending on the results of load testing
